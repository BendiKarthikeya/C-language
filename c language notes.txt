identifer: name given to any form of variable 
variable :int is the key word 

#include<stdio.h>
void main(){
int num1=6;
printf("num1 is %d",num1);
}

Rule 1: It can use a-z,A-Z,0-9(Alphanumaric in nature)
Rule 2: It can start with any character (a or A and _ , But the shouldnot be a number)
RUle 3: There shouldnot be any space in between the character of defining the identifier 
Rule 4: It is case sensitive 
Rule 5: We cant use keyword as an identifier 
Rule 6: The identifier of a variable you are declaring should make some sense 
Rule 7: I cant intialise the variable with similar name 

printf("num1 is %d",num1);

printf works with R to L order of precedence
